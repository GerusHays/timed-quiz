# Javascript timed Quiz
## Purpose
The purpose of this webpage is to generate a random password between 8 and 128 characters. </br>
Users have the option to select the length of their password and whether or not to include: Uppercase or Lowercase letters, numbers and special characters. </br>
If the user inputs a number less than 8 or greater than 128 it will do nothing and they will have to click the generate button once more to select a number between the given length. </br>
Once the user selects a length they will have 4 windows populate to confirm what characters they would like to include in their password.</br>
If they confirm all 4 windows their password will include all 4 types of characters. </br>
However, if they confirm 2 and cancel 2 the password will only include what characters they have confirmed that will populate in the text box. </br>

## Moving Forward
I have included two issues within my github repository I would like to resolve on my own moving forward.
- Include some type of message to inform the user they have to select at least something for the password to generate. Even though I feel this is self explanatory which is why i did not include it here.
- Add a reset button. Currently whenever the generate button is pressed to generate a brand new password you have to refresh the page. To fix this it would be a good idea to include a reset button next to the generate button to reset the password text to populate a brand new random password.
